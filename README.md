# Python-Web-Scraping-Splits

The purpose of this project is to use the Selenium library to create a script that will automatically scrape information about baseball games from a website. Using this information and a formula, it will write to a text file that will show players who should be bet on to hit under 0.5 homeruns in their next game. 
The formula is simple and pretty much relies on: 
1) Only pick players from the underdog team
2) Only pick players who have or are below .200 AVG against the pitcher they will face
3)  Only players who have at least 5 AB against that pitcher
4)  Only players who have no home runs hit against that pitcher

This may change and be adjusted, but it is a good spot to go off of for the time being.
The odds for these picks are always pretty bad so it is not exactly the best strategy. I do not really intend on actually using this with real money. I thought it was just good inspiration for a project to learn about Selenium and web scraping in general.
